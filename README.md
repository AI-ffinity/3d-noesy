# Idea

Theoretically, the closer the two nuclei together, (here: Â¹H) the stronger the NOE signal between them.  
It it practically true though?

# Data source
The ARTINA dataset: 
https://nmrdb.ethz.ch/

# Hypotheses to test
- **H1**: the most intense peak per spin system is $H^A_{i}$
- **H2**: the 2nd most intense is $H^A_{i-1}$ and the 3rd is $H^N_{i-1}$
- **H3**: the most intense inter-residual $H^N$ peak per spin system is $H^N_{i-1}$

## Discussion

The NOE "anomalities" can be explaned by the dynamics of interacting groups. 

NOE is a consequence of dipole-dipole interactions, which in turn happens by two mechanisms: double- and zero-quantum (DQ and ZQ). In the mobile environments DQ transfer prevails: *there are higher chances of the nucleus to vibrate on the frequency twice of the Larmor frequency*. For ZQ transfer mechanism, the nuclei must move with respect to each other on nearly zero frequency, i.e. *stand still for a brief time*. This is possible in large, rigid parts and viscous environments, such as protein cores. 

Signs of DQ- and ZQ-driven NOEs are opposite. Hence, in the regime of *intermediate chemical exchange* NOE crosspeaks will approach 0 intensity (from one or the other side).
