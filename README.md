# Idea

Theoretically, the closer the two nuclei together, (here: Â¹H) the stronger the NOE signal between them.  
It it practically true though?

## Hypotheses to test
- **H1**: the most intense peak per spin system is $H^A_{i}$
- **H2**: the 2nd most intense is $H^A_{i-1}$ and the 3rd is $H^N_{i-1}$
- **H3**: the most intense inter-residual $H^N$ peak per spin system is $H^N_{i-1}$

# Results
## The most intense peak per spin system is $H^A_{i}$

**TLDR**: No. Sometimes there are other interresidual peaks that are more intense. 

## The 2nd most intense is $H^A_{i-1}$ and the 3rd is $H^N_{i-1}$
*In the light of the first outcome refactored into*
### H2A:. **The most intense peaks of a spin system are either $H^A_{i}$, $H^A_{i-1}$, or $H^N_{i-1}$

### H2B: $H^A_{i-1}$ > $H^N_{i-1}$

## the most intense inter-residual $H^N$ peak per spin system is $H^N_{i-1}$
