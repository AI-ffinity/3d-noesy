# Idea

Theoretically, the closer the two nuclei together, (here: Â¹H) the stronger the NOE signal between them.  
It it practically true though?

## Hypotheses to test
- **H1**: the most intense peak per spin system is $H^A_{i}$
- **H2**: the 2nd most intense is $H^A_{i-1}$ and the 3rd is $H^N_{i-1}$
- **H3**: the most intense inter-residual $H^N$ peak per spin system is $H^N_{i-1}$
